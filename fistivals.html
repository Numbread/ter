                <h1>1. Caracol Festival</h1>
                <p>Through the passage of Resolution 351, this has been an official festival in Makati that pays tribute to Filipino resilience. The name of the festival was derived from the Spanish word for “snail”, a shelled creature that symbolizes the people’s efforts to combat difficulties. Caracol Festival invites the spectators in merrymaking as the participants parade with their masks and nature-inspired costumes. This takes place during the last Sunday of January and is considered as Makati City’s version of Rio de Janeiro’s Mardi Gras.sss</p>

                <h1>3. Bailes delos Arcos</h1>
                <p>Bailes Delos Arcos is one of the most exciting festivals that entices many tourists who book for Makati hotels. Barangay Poblacion holds this annual feast every 29th of June in honor of Virgen Dela Rosa, St. Peter, and St. Paul. This is a much-awaited event because the festival involves the participation of young ladies who train for a year for the so called “Dance of Virgins”. They offer this amazing performance in a kind of pledged devotion to the patron saints.</p>
